# Climate Change: A Time Series Approach
Repo for Time Series Fall 2019 term project exploring climate change effects on North America

## Project Background

This project began as a final assignment for a masters-level course at Santa Clara University, <i>Applied Time Series Analysis</i> with [Dan Trepanier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dantrepanier/). The goal of the initial project was to apply all techniques covered in the course to answer a semi-open-ended: <b>Is North America Warming Up?</b>.

The nature of the question also meant that we (students) had the freedom to conduct any analysis we see fit, as well as combine the provided [data](http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/gridded_obs/index_gridded_obs.html) with any appropirate auxilliary data that may help in answering the question (we'll go over the dataset I used in detail later).

I decided to continue working on this project post-graduation because:
1. It was an opportunity for me to take on a time-series project to the end
2. Polish my writing skills (in both coding and report writing)
3. I truly believe that mastering a skill requires one to also think about it outside of their professional lives. This is my way of strengthening my statistical knowledge

## Abstract of Project Results
AS OF Dec 10, 2019:

The data is too small to conclusively claim North America is truly warming up. Furthermore, as of today, the analysis looks at temperature changes across the United States as whole. This may dampen down the effects of climate change on temperatures across North America. Future work includes looking at temperature changes at the local level, where real, absolute temperature changes could be felt by everyday people.
